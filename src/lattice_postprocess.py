"""
Hidden Number Problem (HNP) lattice post-processor for Shor-ECDLP measurements.

The textbook (Lelli-style) recovery uses per-shot direct extraction
``d = (r - j) * k^{-1} (mod n)`` followed by verification — which we've
shown is verification-filter dominated even at noiseless small ``m`` and
gives zero collective signal on the 22-bit IBM run.

The HNP approach treats *all shots' constraints jointly*: each
measurement contributes a noisy linear constraint on ``d``, and LLL/BKZ
lattice reduction finds the ``d`` that simultaneously satisfies them
(closest-vector). When genuine quantum signal is present at sub-rounding
resolution, this can recover ``d`` from shots that direct extraction
treats as noise.

This is the D-1 path from the 2026-05-21 planning session — a *clean*
implementation independent of CF-Lift candidate enumeration and free of
the verification-filter shortcut. See ``project_collective_vote_findings``
in memory for the strategic context.

Status: **prototype skeleton** — pinned interface and lattice construction
based on Boneh–Venkatesan 1996. Validation against noiseless small-``m``
Aer data is the next step; do not rely on the output for hardware data
until that empirical calibration is done.

Reference: Ekerå (2017) eprint.iacr.org/2017/1027 for the cleaner
modular reduction of two-register Shor's algorithm — the lattice
construction below is the natural HNP variant of that relation.

    for some integer ``s_i ∈ [0, n)`` (the hidden Shor peak index).
    Stacked across ``N`` shots, this is a multivariate HNP with
    unknowns ``d, s_1, …, s_N``.

    Lattice basis (``N+1`` generators, ``N+1`` columns):

      - Row 0 (the "d generator"): ``[n·k_1, n·k_2, …, n·k_N, B]``
        where ``B = 1`` keeps the d-encoded coordinate small after
        reduction.
      - Row i (for ``i ∈ [1, N]``, the "s_i generator"):
        ``[0, …, -M (column i-1), …, 0, 0]``.

    A lattice point ``α · row_0 + Σ_i β_i · row_i`` has coordinates
    ``(α · n · k_i − β_i · M  for i, α · B)``. Setting ``α = d`` and
    ``β_i = s_i`` makes the first ``N`` coordinates equal
    ``n · d · k_i − s_i · M``, which is close to ``-n · j_i`` (the
    target) by the Shor relation. The last coordinate is then ``d``,
    encoding the recovered key.

    Returns ``(B, target)`` where ``target = [-n·j_1, …, -n·j_N, 0]``.
    Caller embeds CVP→SVP and runs LLL/BKZ; ``hnp_recover`` does this.

    Note: ``r`` is intentionally NOT used — the post-pt-measurement
    state's R₀ shifts the Shor lattice but the QFT peak positions in
    (j, k) are the same set for every R₀.

    ⚠️ CONVENTION & DEGENERACY (verified 2026-05-29 — read before relying
    on the argmax):

    * Production callers (``azure_quantum_fetch``, ``cross_platform_analysis``,
      ``boundary_scan_*``) pass ``j, k`` **reduced mod n** (∈ [0, n)), NOT
      the full-width registers described below. On noiseless data the
      full-width form is degenerate (d=0 wins trivially, score monotone in
      d), so the reduced form is the one that carries signal and the one
      every pipeline actually uses. The full-width derivation in the rest
      of this docstring is the *ideal* relation; treat the reduced-input
      behaviour as the operative one.
    * The score is symmetric under ``d ↔ (n − d)`` (= anti_d): on noiseless
      m=3 data BOTH d_true and anti_d sit far below the noise plateau, but
      **anti_d, not d_true, is the argmax**. The ±d tie is unbreakable by
      this metric alone. Therefore "argmax == d_true" is NOT a meaningful
      signal claim — the defensible statistic is whether the d-CLASS
      {d_true, anti_d} separates from the plateau (see
      ``scripts/hnp_score_matrix.py`` for the d-class audit anchored to a
      noiseless ground-truth row). Disambiguation of d_true vs anti_d is
      done downstream by EC verification, not by this score.


    After measuring the point register at some ``R_0``, the two-register
    Shor (j, k) state is supported on the lattice
    ``L_d(R_0) = {(jₛ, kₛ) ∈ [0, M)² : jₛ + d·kₛ ≡ R_0 (mod n)}``.
    Inverse-QFT-ing concentrates that lattice's amplitude at
    ``(j_m, k_m)`` such that
    ``j_m + d · k_m ≡ round(s · M / n) (mod M)``
    for *some* integer ``s ∈ [0, n)`` — the "Shor index" of the peak,
    a hidden variable that varies per shot. Note that ``r`` (the
    measured point) does **not** enter this modular relation: ``r``
    selects which lattice ``L_d(R_0)`` we project into, but the QFT
    peaks of every such lattice live at the same set of ``(j_m, k_m)``.

    The score is therefore
    ``score(d) = Σ_i  min_{s ∈ [0, n)} | (j_i + d·k_i) mod M - round(s·M/n) |²``

    For the correct ``d`` the residuals are bounded by ~M/(2n) and the
    total is small; for wrong ``d`` the (j + d·k) mod M values are
    pseudo-uniform in [0, M) and the residual is large. The ``r`` field
    of each shot is unused by this score — kept in the function
    signature to match the parsed-shot tuple shape.

    Corrected formulation per ``docs/lattice_hnp_design.md`` — fixes

    1. Adds q-ary modulus rows for the ``(mod n·M)`` wrap of the Shor
       relation ``n·(j + d·k) ≡ s·M (mod n·M)``. Without these rows
       the lattice can only solve exact equalities and LLL collapses to
       the trivial zero vector.
    2. Scales the d-tracker by ``W_d = ⌈M/(2n)⌉`` so the d coordinate
       contributes comparably to the per-shot residual; with ``W_d=1``
       any d is "free" and reduction zeroes the d coordinate.
    3. Scales the Kannan-embedding sentinel by ``⌈√N · M/(2n)⌉`` so
       the embedded short vector reliably contains the target.

    Basis layout (``(2N + 1) × (N + 1)``):

      Row 0          d-generator   ``[ n·k_1, ..., n·k_N,  W_d ]``
      Row 1..N       s_i           ``[ 0,..., -M (col i-1),..., 0 ]``
      Row N+1..2N    modulus n·M   ``[ 0,..., n·M (col i-1),..., 0 ]``

    Target  ``[ -n·j_1, ..., -n·j_N,  0 ]`` is Kannan-embedded into an
    extra column whose only nonzero entry is ``sentinel`` (on the
    target row).

    After LLL/BKZ, scan rows for ``|last col| == sentinel``; the one

      2. Take the ``top_n_shots`` most peak-like shots.

    pool from a coarse exhaustive scan; for small n the default
    exhaustive sweep is cheap (<1s for n=31 with 50 shots).
